		CHANGES in `gamboostLSS' VERSION 1.1-2 (2014-06-25, r106)

  o  added survival to suggests and load it in tests to reflect recent changes
     in mboost

  o  removed the generic function risk() as this function is now defined in mboost

  o  bugfix: check if response is correct for the family before the offset is
     computed


		CHANGES in `gamboostLSS' VERSION 1.1-1 (2014-06-16, r104)

  o  re-added tests
  o  changed \dontrun to \donttest in examples


		CHANGES in `gamboostLSS' VERSION 1.1-0 (2014-06-12, r103)

  o  added new function cvrisk for generic cross-validation (gamboostLSS now
     requires mboost >= 2.2-3 for the generic function definition)
  o  added a function to obtain cross-validation grids (make_grid)

  o  added new function as.families to include gamlss families in gamboostLSS
  o  added new families BetaLSS, GammaLSS, GaussianLSS, ZIPoLSS, ZINBLSS
  o  GaussianLSS is now the default family

  o  added new functions predint() and plot(predint()) to obtain and plot
     marginal prediction intervals

  o  added stabilization factor for negative gradients (MAD):
     turn on the stabilization by using
     > options(gamboostLSS_stab_ngrad = TRUE)

  o  added new data sets india and india.bnd

  o  bugfix: Speed of model fitting was dependent on iteration,
     i.e. the algorithm got slower for larger mstop values

  o  lots of minor improvements in the interface and methods

  o  improved manuals in various places


		CHANGES in `gamboostLSS' VERSION 1.0-3 (2011-11-16, r49)

  o  fixed potential problem that might occur if users specify different
     outcomes for different components

  o  fixed bug in regtest-gamboostLSS.R

  o  removed duplicated (and slightly altered) code from mboost
     that was required to make gamboostLSS work with earlier versions of mboost;
     gamboostLSS now requires mboost >= 2.0-12


		CHANGES in `gamboostLSS' VERSION 1.0-2 (2011-08-31)
